            <p>An expose on the business practices of Theranos, a startup that claimed accurate blood tests from a single drop of blood. The company never produced readers that worked, suppressed employees who did not agree with the CEO, and defradued investors of several billion dollars.</p>

What do we take for granted when we cross the street? This book provides an all encompassing perspective on the development of homo sapiens that I would call a must read.</p>
