        <p>As the final week of the College Football season approaches, commonly referred to as Rivalry week, the 4 teams to be selected for College Football Playoff seem to be as clear cut as ever. For as much as we think we know the best 4 teams, the Week 13 rankings provided by the College Football Playoff Committee once again raises eyebrows. 5 teams with 4 losses are ranked, an all time high. UCF is ranked higher than Ohio State. And LSU, despite 2 losses (including a 29-0 blowout), is ranked above all of them at #7. Perhaps there is merit to each of these decisions, however without explanation or transparency from the committee, the current system is imperfect to many. To understand the purpose of the College Football Playoff, and how to fix this system, we must look at the history of college football's ranking system.</p>
